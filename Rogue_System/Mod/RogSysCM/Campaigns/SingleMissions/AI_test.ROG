--OTHER NOTES:
----Flights with capital ships (anything that can launch another ship) can only have 1 ship per flight
----The first task must ALWAYS be an arrival task (Type = 4)
----Manually assigned tail numbers, for missions, are in the range of primary 80 - 99, UNLESS using a pre-existing ship (if the tail number is not found, then a new ship created with a random tail number)
----flights with either primary/secondary of -1, or ranges outside of primary 80 - 99, will be randomly assigned
----the ship name (sName) is used to link a flight to their mothership. MAKE SURE THE NAMES ARE IDENTICAL!
